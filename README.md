## Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering: A Clustering Analysis

Founded in 1997 by Marc and Reed in Los Gatos, California, Netflix has grown into the world's foremost on-demand streaming and online DVD rental service. Boasting 69 million members across 60 countries who collectively consume over 100 million hours of content daily, Netflix stands as the premier internet entertainment service, offering a diverse array of TV shows, documentaries, and feature films in numerous languages and genres. In my exploration of Netflix's content landscape, I utilized a dataset compiled in 2019 from Fixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. Noteworthy insights from 2018 reveal a significant surge in TV show offerings, nearly tripling since 2010, while the number of movies on the platform has decreased by over 2,000 titles during the same period. This dataset serves as a gateway to deeper analysis, with the potential to integrate external datasets like IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes scores, unveiling a broader understanding of audience preferences and content dynamics in the ever-evolving world of streaming entertainment.
